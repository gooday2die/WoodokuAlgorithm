# Woodoku Algorithm
Woodoku is a mobile game that is kinda like Tetris. You can move blocks into specific places and clear out rows, columns, and blocks of 3x3. It's very addictive and I was playing that game for a long time. So, I decided to make an algorithm that solves Woodoku game itself. **It will NOT be perfect, however I will try.**
